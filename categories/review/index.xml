      <description>Microsoft recently took my attention thanks to its open-source move for a lot of their .NET core framework, and a bunch of other libraries (see Microsoftâ€™s github).
Add to that their recent partnership with Red Hat and Canonical, and the idea of testing the last Windows release suddenly came to my mind. Last factor : my recent issues with Xen and ATI Drivers on Win 7 virtual machine, and the lack of time to resolve them for now, leave me with no other choice than moving to Windows for gaming.</description>
