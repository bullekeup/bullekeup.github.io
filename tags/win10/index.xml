      <description>WARNING: Your USB device will be totally erased from all content ! Do a backup if needed !
Very small howto, just because I found many people who doesn’t know how to create a Windows 10 bootable USB device with EFI support.

      <description>Microsoft recently took my attention thanks to its open-source move for a lot of their .NET core framework, and a bunch of other libraries (see Microsoft’s github).
Add to that their recent partnership with Red Hat and Canonical, and the idea of testing the last Windows release suddenly came to my mind. Last factor : my recent issues with Xen and ATI Drivers on Win 7 virtual machine, and the lack of time to resolve them for now, leave me with no other choice than moving to Windows for gaming.</description>
